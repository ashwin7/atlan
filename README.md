# Atlan Challange

### Sample Queries:
+ ```SELECT * FROM dataTable;```
+ ```SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email FROM dataTable;```


### Loading Time : < 2.5sec

## Performance Optimizations?
- By using *`React Code Splitting :`* React Lazy Loading, i.e. loading files/scripts only when the component renders.
- By minimizing the 3rd-Party Packages.
- By writing custom CSS and using mostly tailwind classes.
- Checking for unnecessary re-renders and fixing them
